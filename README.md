# Patch-Recovery
This CI service patches recovery images of Samsung to enable Fastbootd. Based on Phh's [script](https://github.com/phhusson/samsung-galaxy-a51-gsi-boot)

# How to use:
- Upload your recovery to https://www.filesend.jp/l/en-US/ or any other file hosting sites. Once uploaded right click on the Download button and copy the URL
- Head over to Actions tab. Click on RECOVERY and then Run workflow. Insert the copied URL in the RECOVERY URL field and Start the workflow
- The Patching process will start
- You will get a URL at the end of the process from where you can download the Patched Recovery
